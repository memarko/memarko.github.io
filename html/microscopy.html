<h1>Microscopy</h1>
<p>With money to spend I decided to buy a microscope. There were 2
other options a professional photo camera or telescope. Since I am
not in photography and a lot of people bought it I rule out camera.
Stars are really too far away to touch and looking at them is quite
useless compared with microscope. So that is why I decided to buy a
microscope.</p>
<p>I bought one good binocular microscope over Amazon. When I
already ordered it I found out there was one much cheaper in local
supermarket. Because the one from supermarket included also base
glass and some equipment I decided to bought the cheaper too.</p>
<p>I was a bit disappointed at first about what I can see. There
was almost no one cell organisms big enough to be seen with
ordinary microscope 1600x magnification. But after playing with it
accident happened. Cover glass fell down on the floor. When I tried
to reach it I step on it, broke it and cut my skin. Blood was
running out. So I decided to look at it under the microscope.</p>

<p>It was like a magic. I had never seen something like that.
Square pieces touching each other were flowing around. When there
was some obstacle or turn some of those squares become triangles so
there was minimum empty space between them. This is how blood looks
like. Unfortunately this cannot be seen so clearly on the
picture.</p>

<p>One day I was also playing with reflection pictures. They are
not magnified a lot but they look quite good.</p>
